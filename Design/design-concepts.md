#Design Concepts

Overall I wanted a very simplistic concept that is easy on the eyes and not too flashy. I think that when it comes to sites where there is a lot of text information you want to have concise placemeent of your information.
A very user friendly experience is what I want to aim for to see how crisp of a design I can make.

When users see my site and it's design I want them to feel like the content on the page is the main attraction. I don't want users to have their eyes straying away from the information that is presented on the page. I want users to feel at ease while being on my site.

http://www.csszengarden.com/211/ this was probably the most inspirational design I saw. This page was very ellegant and clean when it came to displaying all the information. The information wasn't drowned out by too many special effects or overall eye candy.
